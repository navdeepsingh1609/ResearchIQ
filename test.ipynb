By analogy with the pseu an effective electron-electron interaction is deve lopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, loped which closely reproduces the scattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero electron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this smooth ef ective interaction has no cusp at zero electron- electron separation. We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both with the Coulomb electron-electron interacti: interaction. We find that convergence of the C electron-electron interaction is not significantly Coulomb interaction for energy differences on the on and with the smooth effective electron-electron expansion of the wave function for the smooth improved compared with that for the divergent order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to popular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting factor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations.\n",

      "The primary difficulty in solving the Schrédinger equa- tion for many-electron systems arises from the presence of the electron-electron interaction, which results in a problem non-separable in the electron coordinates. Con- figuration interaction (CI) calculations use an expansion of the many-body wave function in configuration state functions (CSF) given by spin coupled sums of determi- nants built from single-particle orbitals. One of the cen- tral difficulties for the convergence of the CI expansion is thought to arise from the behaviour of the Coulomb interaction at small electron-electron separations [1410}. The many-body wave function must have an appropriate cusp at electron coalescences so that the infinite Coulomb interaction term is exactly cancelled by an opposite di- vergence of the kinetic energy (ij.\n",
      "\n",
      "A completely different point of view, taken by Gilbert in 1963 (5], is that the difficulty of CI wave functions in describing short-range effects of the cusp are energetically unimportant and that the benefit of the explicitly corre- lated approach is that the entire Coulomb hole, with a size on the order of the atomic orbitals, is much easier to describe in terms of interelectronic coordinates. Gilbert’s suggestion appears to have received little attention and the idea that smoothing out the Coulomb potential and removing the cusp altogether will automatically lead to an improved CI convergence has been stated in the liter- ature [16,9]. However, no systematic studies of the effect of the electron cusp on CI energy convergence at the level of interest for chemical accuracy (1 mHartree for total energies) have been presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is often stated in the literature that failure of CI expansion to reproduce the correct electron cusp, i.e. the short-range part of the Coulomb hole, leads to a slow convergence in the energy with respect to the number of CSF’s [8]. While this has been shown [2\"5] in the asymptotic regime (ie. very large angular momentum | and energy errors of the order of 10~° Hartree), it is not clear that it applies in the practical regime (mHartree accuracy) for multi-electron systems. he F Ss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explicit inclusion of terms in the interelectronic tance (rj2 methods) [1244] or the_use of correlated (gem- inal) Gaussian basis functions (13) significantly improve the convergence of a CI calculation. For the helium atom, the inclusion of r12 terms 5 yields an expansion in partial waves converging asymtotically as 1~® or better, instead of aslow /~°, where | is the maximum angular momentum in the expansion. Baker et al. [14] also showed that using basis functions with the same analytic structure as the true wave function (depending on powers and logarithms of riz) leads to a reduced expansion length. The suc- cess of methods explicitly including riz terms has been is-\n",
      "\n",
      "In this paper, we explore whether a significant im- provement in the convergence of the CI expansion is obtained when the true Hamiltonian is replaced by one which has a smooth and finite electron-electron interac- tion (pseudo-interaction) at short distances and, conse- quently, smooth eigenfunctions with no cusps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprisingly, in calculations for the He and Be atoms, we find that removing the divergence of the Coulomb potential at electron-electron coalescences does not sig- nificantly reduce the length of the CI expansion, thereby substantiating the argument put forward by Gilbert (15) that the slow convergence should be attributed to dif ficulties in describing, not the interelectron cusp, but the intermediate-range electronic correlation. The poor treatment of the interelectron cusp in the CI expansion is not a limiting factor at the mHartree level of accuracy on the total energy. To further confirm this result, we calcu- ate the energy within quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for the true electron-electron interaction with accurate wave ‘unctions which explicitly contain interelectronic coordi- nates, and then deliberately remove the short-range cor-\n",

Finally, we demonstrate that the con- vergence behavior of the CI expansion as a function of angular momentum in the range practical for many ap- plications (1 < 6) is largely unaffected by the smoothing of the electron cusps. Therefore, the angular momentum convergence numerically observed by other authors [V7 is related to problems associated with intermediate range correlations, not the cusp region as such.\n",

Tih we report the QMC and CI energies for He and Be atoms using the true and pseudo electron interaction. i, we discuss the numerical generation and accuracy of the electron pseudo-interaction, and in Appendix 'G we define a short-range correlation term which can be associated with it. In Appendix D, we briefly discuss the evaluation of two-electron integrals for the pseudo-interaction. ...\n",

      "When modifying the short-distance electron-electron interaction, we wish to keep the intermediate- and long- range correlation properties of the many-body eigen- states unchanged. This will allow us to isolate systemati- cally the effects of the short-range cusp-like behaviour in he wave function. To achieve this, our new (smooth) in- eraction should ideally have electron-electron scattering properties identical to the true interaction for all ener- gies. If this were the case, all many-electron eigenvalues would be identical for both interactions. While this ideal cannot be exactly realized, we expect that a potential with the same scattering properties as the true interac- ion over a sufficiently wide range of scattering energies will give many-electron eigenvalues very close to the true ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "This goal for electron-electron scattering is analogous o the problem of electron-ion scattering addressed in the well-established pseudopotential method 17]. In that ap- proach, the aim is to produce a smooth electron-ion po- ential which reproduces the single-particle eigenvalues of the true system over a range of energies, and has the same single-particle wave functions outside some suitably chosen cut-off radius r.. Such pseudopotentials are gen- erated for the isolated atom but may then be used with a high level of accuracy in molecules and solids. In solids, he smoothness of the potential greatly improves the con- vergence of plane-wave expansions for single-particle or- bitals (13}.\n",

For the Be atom, the 2s and 2p configura- tions are included in the determinantal part of the wave function and DMC gives the best energy subject to the fixed-node condition.

As discussed in A any potential which differs from the ex- act 1/r interaction would be expected, from first order erturbation theory, to converge at least quadratically in re to the exact energy Eo for small r.. Since Verr is not explicitly constructed to eliminate first order errors in Vere(r) — 1/r, quadratic convergence is seen for Very and he fitting parameters are: a = —0.3279, b = —0.3839, c = 0.6758, d = —0.2622, and e = 0. On the other hand, the norm-conserving pseudo-interaction construc- ion of Sec. [1 xplicitly ensures that the first-order erturbation correction to the energy is zero. The He ground state energy as a function of r, using Vps can indeed be fitted without the quadratic term, and even he cubic term proves to be small, the polynomial coef- ficients being: a = 0, b = 0.0188, c = —0.1023, d = 0, and e = 0.0280. For He, the energies obtained using Vps(r) are within 1 mHartree of the energy computed with the true Coulomb interaction for values of r. < 0.4 a.u. Since the typical electron-electron distance in the He ground state is of the order of 1 a.u., these results in- dicate that the first peak of the electron pair-distribution function provides a good measure of how large a cut-off radius r, may be used to obtain accurate total energies with V,s(r): re should be approximately half the radius at which this first peak occurs.

Cl, This trial wave function includes considerable variational freedom in the interelec- tronic terms and obtains 100% of the correlation energy. As can be seen in Fig. Pa removal of the cusp out to radii of 0.5 a.u. causes little degradation of the quality of the energy obtained with this wave function.

      "The main result of our study is that a description of he electron cusp as such is not a limiting factor in cal- culating correlation effects with configuration interaction methods at the mHartree level of accuracy. We are led © this conclusion since the replacement of the diver- gent Coulomb interaction with a finite interaction leaves he convergence properties largely unchanged. The slow convergence of CI expansions in this energy range must e attributed to medium-range correlations, which are present for both types of electron interaction. The results obtained by explicitly removing the cusp from accurate variational wave functions support this conclusion, show- ing that the cusp of the wave function is not energetically important. This is found, even when cusp-like behaviour is removed out to a distance of half the typical interelec- tronic separation.\n",

The Landau damping strongly reduces this conductivity in the domain of ultrarelativistic electrons at temperatures below the electron plasma temperature.

In ve; we include all collisions of electrons mediated by their interactions with ions (direct Coulomb scattering of electrons by ions in an ion gas or liquid; electron-phonon scattering in an ion crystal and electron scattering by impurity ions at low temperatures). Evidently, Eq. (jj) can be rewritten\n",

      "Specifically, we will consider the thermal conductiv- ity of degenerate electrons. It is important in metals, semiconductors as well as in degenerate cores of evolved stars (giants, supergiants and, most importantly, white dwarfs), and in envelopes of neutron stars. It is needed to study cooling of white dwarfs (e.g., Prada Moroni and Straniero [B]) and nuclear explosions of massive white dwarfs as _type Ta supernovae (e.g., Baraffe, Heger and Woosley [/]). In neutron star envelopes it is required for many reasons — for simulating cooling of isolated neu- tron stars (see, e.g., Lattimer et al. fi, Gnedin, Yakovlev and Potekhin [6], Page, Geppert and Weber (i); for studying heat propagation and thermal relaxation in a neutron star envelope in response to the various processes of crustal energy release. In particular, these processes include pulsar glitches (e.g., Larson and Link [&], and ref- erences therein), deep crustal heating of accreting neu- tron stars in soft X-ray transients (e.g., Ushomirsky and Rutledge [9}), superbursts as powerful nuclear explosions at the base of the outer crust of an accreting neutron star e.g., Strohmayer and Bildsten [10]; Page and Cumming ii).\n",

The ee collisions would be negligible for the iron plasma if the data for this plasma were displayed in Figure 2.

      "Starting from the shell structure in atoms and the significant correlation within electron pairs, we distinguish the exchange-correlation effects between two electrons of opposite spins occupying the same orbital from the average correlation among many electrons in a crystal. In the periodic potential of the crystal with lattice constant larger than the effective Bohr radius of the valence electrons, these correlated electron pairs can form a metastable energy band above the corresponding single-electron band separated by an energy gap. In order to determine if these metastable electron pairs can be stabilized, we calculate the many-electron exchange-correlation renormalization and the polaron correction to the two-band system with single electrons and electron pairs. We find that the electron-phonon interaction is essential to counterbalance the Coulomb repulsion and to stabilize the electron pairs. The interplay of the electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, manifested in the exchange-correlation energies, polaron effects, and screening, is responsible for the formation of electron pairs (bipolarons) that are located on the Fermi surface of the single-electron band.\n",

      "Since the discovery of high T, superconductivity by Bednorz and Miller|I) in 1986, great progresses have been made in the experimental and theoretical investi- gation of unconventional superconductivity. However, the mechanism of electron pairing in unconventional su- perconductors remains one of the most challenging and unresolved problems in condensed matter physics. | Vast experimental evidences have shown that elec- tron pairing and unconventional superconductivity oc- cur in many different materials, such as cuprates, [I}- [aj iron-based superconductors, |518] and carbon-based superconductors dh {10} etc. Although there are many different theories for unconventional superconductivity, almost _all theories follow the basic idea of the BCS heory {11}.

These pairs are preformed well above T, and at T. undergo Bose- Einstein condensation. (19, {13 Investigations performed by Zhong e al.

      "in crystals where we consider the electron-electron corre- lation, the periodic potential of the crystal lattice, and the electron-phonon interaction. Our theory is different from all previous ones. We obtain preformed small elec- tron pairs in the periodic potential of the crystal. This is essentially an orbital dependent electron-pairing theory in which the exchange-correlation between two electrons occupying the same orbital is decisive for pair formation. However such pairs are metastable unless the electron- phonon interaction is included. The calculations show hat the electron-phonon coupling and the polaron ef- fects are responsible for the stabilization of the electron pairs.\n",

      "Our basic idea for the electron pairing process is hat the electron-electron correlation is orbital depen- dent. Within the jellium model for the electron gas in solids, the atomic nuclei that form the periodic lat- ice are smeared out into a uniform positive charge dis- ribution. Each electron is totally delocalized. There- fore, many electrons “see” each other with their fluctua- ion potential at the same time and thus correlate all at once, giving rise to collective screening and oscillation effects. However, in atoms and molecules, a ifi correlations occur within electron pairs.[17 Strong exchange-correlation interaction between two electrons in he same orbital manifests in the shell structure of atoms and also in the covalent and ionic bonding in molecules. Our starting point in this study is to distinguish the exchange-correlation effects between two electrons of op- posite spins occupying the same atomic orbital from the average correlation among many electrons in a crystal. This may happen in a crystal but the electrons have to “feel” the nuclei potential well. This leads to a prelimi- nary condition that the effective Bohr radius of the va- ence electrons in the crystal has to be comparable or smaller than the lattice constant. For instance, for a cuprate crystal with effective electron mass m* ~ 5mo and static dielectric constant €9 ~ 30, the effective Bohr radius ag ~ 3.2 A is smaller than the lattice constant of about 3.8 A. Because we want to show that the electron- pair correlation in atoms can manifest themselves in elec- tron transport in crystals, our calculations have to start first with the formation of energy bands. {20}\n",

Within the independent electron approxima- tion, the electron states are of Bloch form in the periodic potential of the crystal lattice. The effects of electron- electron interactions are accounted for by an effective potential which repeats this periodicity. [20] In this sec- tion, we will show that, besides the energy bands from the single-electron states there can exist a metastable electron-pair energy band depending upon the crystal structure and potential. This metastable electron-pair band originates from two correlated electrons of opposite spins occupying the same atomic orbital.\n",

These helium-like atoms with two electrons of opposite spins occupying the same orbital, e.g. helium atom He and negatively charged hy- drogen anion H~ have played an important role in the development of theoretical physics in the last century. [22 It is a challenge to determine accurately the correlation energy, even in simple systems such as He atom and HO ion.

It is an H~-like state in solid-state environment but with very different energy and length scales (e.g., in GaAs, the effective Ry- dberg Ry=5.9 meV and effective Bohr radius ag=98 A). Therefore, the D~ center in semiconductors is considere as an ideal “laboratory” to study the H~ properties, for instance, in high magnetic fields.{36] Earlier variational calculation by Phelps and Bajaj found the energy of the H™~ in 2D is -4.48 R,-[37 Further numerical calculations obtained -4.48054 R, by Ivanov and Schmelcher|38} an -4.4804798 Ry by Ruan et al.[39}.\n",

If one varies the lattice constant to large values (but not so large as to prevent tunnelling), the Coulomb interaction U for two electrons occupying the same atomic site overcomes the kinetic energy (characterized by the band width W). In this case, each electron should be assigned to its parent atom. The crystal must be nearly the same as a collection of isolated neutral hydrogen atoms and thus it is an insu- lator. This reveals a competition between potential and kinetic effects. At large (small W) the Coulomb repu sion U dominates, the electrons are localized, and the sys- tem is insulating. 4a}. The idea of Mott led to the the- oretical model introduced by Hubbard. {43} The Hubbard model traces the insulating behavior to strong Coulomb repulsion between electrons occupying the same orbital. The competition between the kinetic and Coulomb en- ergies gives rise to strong electron-electron correlations. The Hubbard model was proposed originally to describe the transition between conducting and insulating sys- tems. It has also been widely used to study materials with strongly correlated electrons and high-temperature superconductivity.\n",

Fig. Bia) shows the dispersion relations of the electron states in the 2D crystal potential with A = 1.3 ag and Vo = 15 Ry. The dispersion relation E(k) of the spin-singlet metastable electron-pair band is given together with that of the low- est single-electron band Eo(k). The electron-pair band remains above the corresponding single-electron band be- cause the Coulomb repulsion between the two electrons is stronger than their correlation. However, the shape of he dispersion relations of the two bands are very similar. This confirms the dispersion relation of the electron-pair band discussed in previous section within the framework of the tight-binding approach. The similarity is due to he fact that two paired electrons are closely bound in the relative coordinates in real space with an average separa- ion (r) less than half of the lattice period. Furthermore, he single-electron and electron-pair states in the relative coordinates are of the same symmetry. The average dis- ance between the two electrons in the case of Fig. 2a) is (r) = 0.442. The energy gap between the electron-pair band and the single-electron band is EO), The energy difference between the bottoms of the two bands at [ point is defined as vp. The electron pair behaves as a arger particle with both the mass and charge twice of a single electron. Consequently, the tunneling probability of an electron pair to its neighbor site is much smaller han that of a single electron leading to a much narrower electron-pair band. ...\n",

We see that the electron-pair band appears for E < 0 because the energy spectrum is con- inuous for positive energy in the crystal potential given y Eq. (4). It means that co-tunneling of the paire electrons is required to form the energy band. There- ore, their bandwidth is much smaller than that of the single-electron band. The existence of the metastable electron-pair band is a result of the local confinement in each unit cell, the electron-electron correlation, an he co-tunneling of the electron pair in the crystal.

The many-body effects in the crystal renormalize the band structure. If the band renormalization can bring down he bottom of the electron-pair band to the Fermi sur- ace of the single-electron band, the electron pairs at the ottom of the band cannot decay into two single elec- rons because of the Pauli exclusion principle.

We find that under the considered condition, EL touches the Fermi surface at Ns = 0.4774 az and np = 0.0113 az as indicated by the black dot. For these densities, the electron pairs (or the bipolarons) are stabilized on the Fermi surface. It means that only 4.5% of the electrons in the system form stable electron pairs in this case. If we look at the total energy Fiot, it tends to reduce the energy of the system at the higher single-electron density side. But the electron pairs on the Fermi surface cannot decay into two single electrons due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Moreover, breaking an electron pair needs a cost to overcome their correlation energy.

      "\n",
      "The starting point of our work is that the electron- electron correlation is orbital dependent. The exchange- correlation energy of an electron pair occupying the same orbital is larger than the average of the exchange- correlation energy of many electrons. Depending upon the crystal structure and potential, such electron pairs can form a metastable electron-pair band. The metastable electron-pair band is obtained in two differ- 3. One follows the tight-binding method and the similar to the nearly-free electron model. They give consistent results for the dispersion relation of the electron-pair states in the period potential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combining the metastable electron-pair band together with the corresponding single-electron band, we con- structed a many-particle system consisting of single elec- rons and metastable electron pairs. When further con- sidering many-body interaction renormalization includ- ing single electrons, electron pairs, and optical phonons, we found that the metastable electron pairs can be sta- bilized. The calculations show that the polaron effects play an essential role in counterbalancing the Coulomb repulsion in the stabilization of the electron pairs. The electron-phonon coupling is enhanced in the strongly cor- related electron pairs and leads to the formation of bipo- arons. On the other hand, screening affects significantly both the polaron and bipolaron energies manifesting a cooperative interplay of electron-electron and electron- phonon interactions. The obtained ground state of the system consists of polarons in the single-electron band and bipolarons in the electron-pair band sitting on the Fermi surface of the single-electron band.\n",

However, the physical pro- cesses and numerical calculations for electron pairing can be extended to a quasi-2D crystal of a single atomic layer with finite thickness or to 3D systems. In principle, it can also be extended to study the electron pairing in p- and d-orbitals. The obtained results within the present simple model predict light and small electron pairs (bipo- larons) in the crystal. In the center-of-mass coordinates, the electron pair is a Bloch wavefunction with an effec- tive mass of twice a single electron. The pair is small and local because the average separation between the two electrons is less than half of the lattice constant and they are localized in the same unit cell when expressed in the relative coordinates. Furthermore, only a fraction of the electrons in the system form pairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have obtained a many-particle ground state with spin-singlet electron pairs in the condensate phase. We expect that these preformed electron pairs at certain den- sities in coherent state will contribute to superconduc- tivity. Finally, we want to comment on the possible “su- perconducting energy gap”. From our calculations we naturally infer such a gap to the transition energy re- uired to break the stabilized electron pairs sitting on the Fermi surface. This transition is determined by the Hamiltonian H},, in Eq. where the potential v'(q) was given by Eq. (11) in Ref. [48]. Because the electron pairs are stabilized on the Fermi surface in the center of al the Brillouin zone at k = 0, an external excitation has to overcome the internal correlation energy of an electron pair to bring two electrons to the single-electron states bove the Fermi surface at +k # 0. The minimum en- ergy required (or the gap) is primarily determined by the potential v'(q) and the final momenta +hk of the single-electron states. It is band structure dependent, anisotropic, and nodeless. ...\n",

      "The effect of the electron-electron cusp on the convergence of configuration interaction (CI) wave functions is examined. By analogy with the pseu an effective electron-electron interaction is deve lopotential approach for electron-ion interactions, loped which closely reproduces the scattering of the Coulomb interaction but is smooth and finite at zero electron-electron separation. The exact many-electron wave function for this smooth ef ective interaction has no cusp at zero electron- electron separation. We perform CI and quantum Monte Carlo calculations for He and Be atoms, both with the Coulomb electron-electron interacti: interaction. We find that convergence of the C electron-electron interaction is not significantly Coulomb interaction for energy differences on the on and with the smooth effective electron-electron expansion of the wave function for the smooth improved compared with that for the divergent order of 1 mHartree. This shows that, contrary to popular belief, description of the electron-electron cusp is not a limiting factor, to within chemical accuracy, for CI calculations.\n",

      "The primary difficulty in solving the Schrédinger equa- tion for many-electron systems arises from the presence of the electron-electron interaction, which results in a problem non-separable in the electron coordinates. Con- figuration interaction (CI) calculations use an expansion of the many-body wave function in configuration state functions (CSF) given by spin coupled sums of determi- nants built from single-particle orbitals. One of the cen- tral difficulties for the convergence of the CI expansion is thought to arise from the behaviour of the Coulomb interaction at small electron-electron separations [1410}. The many-body wave function must have an appropriate cusp at electron coalescences so that the infinite Coulomb interaction term is exactly cancelled by an opposite di- vergence of the kinetic energy (ij.\n",
      "\n",
      "A completely different point of view, taken by Gilbert in 1963 (5], is that the difficulty of CI wave functions in describing short-range effects of the cusp are energetically unimportant and that the benefit of the explicitly corre- lated approach is that the entire Coulomb hole, with a size on the order of the atomic orbitals, is much easier to describe in terms of interelectronic coordinates. Gilbert’s suggestion appears to have received little attention and the idea that smoothing out the Coulomb potential and removing the cusp altogether will automatically lead to an improved CI convergence has been stated in the liter- ature [16,9]. However, no systematic studies of the effect of the electron cusp on CI energy convergence at the level of interest for chemical accuracy (1 mHartree for total energies) have been presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is often stated in the literature that failure of CI expansion to reproduce the correct electron cusp, i.e. the short-range part of the Coulomb hole, leads to a slow convergence in the energy with respect to the number of CSF’s [8]. While this has been shown [2\"5] in the asymptotic regime (ie. very large angular momentum | and energy errors of the order of 10~° Hartree), it is not clear that it applies in the practical regime (mHartree accuracy) for multi-electron systems. he F Ss.\n",

      "Explicit inclusion of terms in the interelectronic tance (rj2 methods) [1244] or the_use of correlated (gem- inal) Gaussian basis functions (13) significantly improve the convergence of a CI calculation. For the helium atom, the inclusion of r12 terms 5 yields an expansion in partial waves converging asymtotically as 1~® or better, instead of aslow /~°, where | is the maximum angular momentum in the expansion. Baker et al. [14] also showed that using basis functions with the same analytic structure as the true wave function (depending on powers and logarithms of riz) leads to a reduced expansion length. The suc- cess of methods explicitly including riz terms has been is-\n",

      "In this paper, we explore whether a significant im- provement in the convergence of the CI expansion is obtained when the true Hamiltonian is replaced by one which has a smooth and finite electron-electron interac- tion (pseudo-interaction) at short distances and, conse- quently, smooth eigenfunctions with no cusps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprisingly, in calculations for the He and Be atoms, we find that removing the divergence of the Coulomb potential at electron-electron coalescences does not sig- nificantly reduce the length of the CI expansion, thereby substantiating the argument put forward by Gilbert (15) that the slow convergence should be attributed to dif ficulties in describing, not the interelectron cusp, but the intermediate-range electronic correlation. The poor treatment of the interelectron cusp in the CI expansion is not a limiting factor at the mHartree level of accuracy on the total energy. To further confirm this result, we calcu- ate the energy within quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for the true electron-electron interaction with accurate wave ‘unctions which explicitly contain interelectronic coordi- nates, and then deliberately remove the short-range cor-\n",

Finally, we demonstrate that the con- vergence behavior of the CI expansion as a function of angular momentum in the range practical for many ap- plications (1 < 6) is largely unaffected by the smoothing of the electron cusps. Therefore, the angular momentum convergence numerically observed by other authors [V7 is related to problems associated with intermediate range correlations, not the cusp region as such.\n",

Tih we report the QMC and CI energies for He and Be atoms using the true and pseudo electron interaction. i, we discuss the numerical generation and accuracy of the electron pseudo-interaction, and in Appendix 'G we define a short-range correlation term which can be associated with it.

      "When modifying the short-distance electron-electron interaction, we wish to keep the intermediate- and long- range correlation properties of the many-body eigen- states unchanged. This will allow us to isolate systemati- cally the effects of the short-range cusp-like behaviour in he wave function. To achieve this, our new (smooth) in- eraction should ideally have electron-electron scattering properties identical to the true interaction for all ener- gies. If this were the case, all many-electron eigenvalues would be identical for both interactions. While this ideal cannot be exactly realized, we expect that a potential with the same scattering properties as the true interac- ion over a sufficiently wide range of scattering energies will give many-electron eigenvalues very close to the true ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "This goal for electron-electron scattering is analogous o the problem of electron-ion scattering addressed in the well-established pseudopotential method 17]. In that ap- proach, the aim is to produce a smooth electron-ion po- ential which reproduces the single-particle eigenvalues of the true system over a range of energies, and has the same single-particle wave functions outside some suitably chosen cut-off radius r.. Such pseudopotentials are gen- erated for the isolated atom but may then be used with a high level of accuracy in molecules and solids. In solids, he smoothness of the potential greatly improves the con- vergence of plane-wave expansions for single-particle or- bitals (13}.\n",

For the Be atom, the 2s and 2p configura- tions are included in the determinantal part of the wave function and DMC gives the best energy subject to the fixed-node condition.

As discussed in A any potential which differs from the ex- act 1/r interaction would be expected, from first order erturbation theory, to converge at least quadratically in re to the exact energy Eo for small r.. Since Verr is not explicitly constructed to eliminate first order errors in Vere(r) — 1/r, quadratic convergence is seen for Very and he fitting parameters are: a = —0.3279, b = —0.3839, c = 0.6758, d = —0.2622, and e = 0. On the other hand, the norm-conserving pseudo-interaction construc- ion of Sec. [1 xplicitly ensures that the first-order erturbation correction to the energy is zero. The He ground state energy as a function of r, using Vps can indeed be fitted without the quadratic term, and even he cubic term proves to be small, the polynomial coef- ficients being: a = 0, b = 0.0188, c = —0.1023, d = 0, and e = 0.0280. For He, the energies obtained using Vps(r) are within 1 mHartree of the energy computed with the true Coulomb interaction for values of r. < 0.4 a.u. Since the typical electron-electron distance in the He ground state is of the order of 1 a.u., these results in- dicate that the first peak of the electron pair-distribution function provides a good measure of how large a cut-off radius r, may be used to obtain accurate total energies with V,s(r): re should be approximately half the radius at which this first peak occurs.

Cl, This trial wave function includes considerable variational freedom in the interelec- tronic terms and obtains 100% of the correlation energy. As can be seen in Fig. Pa removal of the cusp out to radii of 0.5 a.u. causes little degradation of the quality of the energy obtained with this wave function. Thus the suc- cess of interelectronic terms in obtaining good variational energies is not primarily due to their description of the short-range cusp behaviour.\n",

As with the cor- relation energies, for a given threshold cmin, the number of CSF’s shows relatively little change for values of r, be- tween 0 and 0.95. Again, it is worth bearing in mind tha’ the typical electron-electron separation is 1 a.u. and tha a cut-off radius rz = 0.95 represents a very smooth inter- action.

      "In this paper we have directly explored the effect of the electron cusp on the convergence of the en- ergy for CI wave functions. To do so, we introduced a fictitious electron-electron interaction which, unlike the true Coulomb potential, does not diverge at elec- tron coalescences and therefore has many-body eigen- functions which are smooth there. The smooth poten- tial is obtained by a method analogous to the well- established treatment of electron-ion interactions with\n",

      "For the He and Be atoms, we have compared the CI expansions of wave functions for the true, Coulomb inter- action and for smooth pseudo-interactions between the electrons. We have also compared the variational en- ergies of highly accurate wave functions containing riz erms, where the cusp condition is exactly satisfied, with he energy for the same wave functions, from which the cusp has been deliberately removed out to a given radius.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main result of our study is that a description of he electron cusp as such is not a limiting factor in cal- culating correlation effects with configuration interaction methods at the mHartree level of accuracy. We are led © this conclusion since the replacement of the diver- gent Coulomb interaction with a finite interaction leaves he convergence properties largely unchanged. The slow convergence of CI expansions in this energy range must e attributed to medium-range correlations, which are present for both types of electron interaction. The results obtained by explicitly removing the cusp from accurate variational wave functions support this conclusion, show- ing that the cusp of the wave function is not energetically important. This is found, even when cusp-like behaviour is removed out to a distance of half the typical interelec- tronic separation.\n",

In Hartree atomic units, the interaction potential is V(r) = 1/r and the reduced mass is 1/2. The radial Schrédinger equation for the relative motion of two electrons is then\n",

      "In the norm-conserving pseudopotential approach, dif ferent scattering potentials are often generated for differ- ent values of the angular momentum |. The full many- body wave function is anti-symmetric with respect to ex- change of any two electrons. Thus, if the two electrons have parallel spin, the orbital part of the wave function must have odd parity and the allowed angular momentum 1 must be odd. Thus, the dominant parallel-spin scat- ering has | = 1. For singlet (anti-parallel) scattering, he orbital part is symmetric and / must be even, with dominant allowed angular momentum | = 0. Following he usual pseudopotential approach, we might then ex- pect to generate a parallel-spin scattering potential using l= 1 and an anti-parallel-spin scattering potential using l= 0. In practice, we find that the | = 0 potential gives good scattering for both angular momenta and the use of separate parallel- and anti-parallel-spin potentials is unnecessary.\n",

Thus, the joint requirements, that r. be sufficiently large to produce a smooth pseudo-interaction and that R. z 2.5r., effec- ively limit the maximum reference energy «; at which he pseudo-interaction construction is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "We find that the pseudo-interaction is transferable (i.e. has very similar scattering strength to the true interac- ion) for energies over a wide range about the reference energy €;, as found previously for electron-ion pseudopo- entials. In particular, we find that transferability is best for energies less than the reference energy at which the seudopotential was generated. This would suggest that he best reference energy to use is the largest energy compatible with the procedure for inversion of the radial Schrédinger equation, a choice confirmed by calculations of many-body eigenstates using pseudo-interaction po- entials generated with different values of the reference energy.APPENDIX B: FIRST ORDER PERTURBATION ANALYSIS OF PSEUDO-INTERACTIONS\n",
