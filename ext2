**We calculate the thermal conductivity of electrons produced by electron-electron Coulomb scat- tering in a strongly degenerate electron gas taking into account the Landau damping of transverse plasmons. The Landau damping strongly reduces this conductivity in the domain of ultrarelativistic electrons at temperatures below the electron plasma temperature. In the inner crust of a neutron star at temperatures T 10? K this thermal conductivity completely dominates over the electron conductivity due to electron-ion (electron-phonon) scattering and becomes competitive with the the electron conductivity due to scattering of electrons by impurity ions.**

## I. INTRODUCTION
The electron thermal conductivity is an important ki- netic property of plasmas in experimental devices, in metals and semiconductors and in astrophysical objects. It has been studied for a long time and described in text- books (see, e.g., Ziman [H, Lifshitz and Pitaevski [l). We will show that some aspects of this problem have to be revised.  
1 1 1 T2TkBne Kei = Ke Kei Kee 3m*Vei Kee 3m*Specifically, we will consider the thermal conductiv- ity of degenerate electrons. It is important in metals, semiconductors as well as in degenerate cores of evolved stars (giants, supergiants and, most importantly, white dwarfs), and in envelopes of neutron stars. It is needed to study cooling of white dwarfs (e.g., Prada Moroni and Straniero l) and nuclear explosions of massive white dwarfs as_type Ia supernovae (e.g., Baraffe, Heger and Woosley [4). In neutron star envelopes it is required for many reasons for simulating cooling of isolated neu- tron stars (see, e.8., Lattimer et al. [5], Gnedin, Yakovlev and Potekhin [6], Page, Geppert and Weber [7I); for studying heat propagation and thermal relaxation in a neutron star envelope in response to the various processes of crustal energy release. In particular, these processes include pulsar glitches (e.g., Larson and Link [8], and ref- erences therein), deep crustal heating of accreting neu- tron stars in soft X-ray transients (e.g., Ushomirsky and Rutledge [0l), superbursts as powerful nuclear explosions at the base of the outer crust of an accreting neutron star (e.g., Strohmayer and Bildsten [10]; Page and Cumming [111).  
(2)where the partial conductivities Kei and Kee are deter- mined, respectively, by the ei and ee collisions.It is widely believed that the dominant contribution into Ke comes from the ei collisions. The associated partial conductivity Kei has been studied in a number of papers (e.g, Potekhin et al. [12], Gnedin et al. [6 and references therein). The partial thermal conductiv- ity Kee owing to the ee collisions was calculated by Lampe [13], Flowers and Itoh [14], Urpin and Yakovlev [5], and Timmes [16] These calculations were summarized by Potekhin et al. [12]. The main result was that the ee col- lisions are mainly negligible, except for a hot low-density plasma of light elements (from hydrogen to carbon) with the temperature a few times lower than the electron de- generacy temperature (in that case the ee collisions did affect Ke but never dominated as long as the electrons were degenerate; see Lampe [13]; Urpin and Yakovlev [15]).It is well known, that the electrons give the main con- tribution into the thermal conductivity of strongly degen- erate matter. Their thermal conductivity can be written asHowever, all these calculations have neglected an im- portant effect of the Landau damping of the ee interac- tion owing to the exchange of transverse plasmons. In the context of transport properties of dense matter this effect was studied by Heiselberg and Pethick [17] for degener- ate quark plasmas. Similar effects have_recently been analyzed by Jaikumar, Gale and Page [18] for neutrino bremsstrahlung radiation in the ee collisions. Here we reconsider Kee including the effects of the Landau damp- ing and show that Kee is actually much more important than thought before.

## II. FORMALISM
We analyze the thermal conductivity Kee of strongly degenerate electrons under the conditions that the elec- trons constitute an almost ideal and uniform Fermi gas and collide between themselves and with plasma ions. Although the results will be more important for ultrarel- ativistic electrons, our consideration will be general and valid for both, relativistic and non-relativistic, cases. We will use the same standard variational approach with the simplest trial non-equilibrium electron distribution func- tion as Flowers and Itoh [4]. The calculations are similar to those performed by Heiselberg and Pethick [7] for the thermal conductivity of quarks; thus we omit the details.

(5) de- pend on w and q and describe the plasma screening of the ee interaction through the exchange of longitudinal and transverse plasmons, respectively. In the classical limit (hq < Pe and hw < vePe), taking into account the polarization produced by degenerate electrons in the first-order random phase approximation, one has (e.g., Alexandrov, Bogdankevich and Rukhadze [21])tively, the electron Fermi momentum and Fermi veloc- ity; the integration is over all allowable ee collisions Pip2 - Pip2; p is an electron momentum, its ve- locity, its energy; primes refer to electrons after a col- lision event; f is the electron Fermi-Dirac distribution, and W(121'2') is the differential transition probability

The symmetry factors required to avoid double counting of the same initial and final elec- tron states are also included into Mfi2.The multi-dimensional integral (3)"is simplified fur- ther using the standard angular-energy decomposition (separating integrations over particle energies and ori- entations of their momenta; e.g., Shapiro and Teukol- sky [19]). . Because the electrons are strongly degener- ate, they can participate in thermal conduction only if their energies are close to the Fermi level. Accordingly, their momenta can be placed at the Fermi surface in an- gular integrals whenever possible. Characteristic energy transfers hw = i - - 1 in collisions of strongly degener- ate particles are small, hw kpT. Momentum transfers hq = pi - pi are also small, hq < pe, owing to a long- range nature of the Coulomb interaction. We will use this small-momentum-transfer approximation throughout the paper. Typical values of hq are determined by plasma screening of the Coulomb interaction.qo being the ordinary Thomas-Fermi electron screening wavenumber. Particularly, in the limit of w - 0 and w/q< ve we have  
> xi = 1, Xt = i Tw/(4qve). (9)According to Eqs. (5) and (6), the plasma screening of the ee current interaction via the exchange of transverse plasmons (the second term in Eq. ( (5) is different from the screening of the charge interaction via the exchange of longitudinal plasmons (the first term). The difference re- sults from the difference of the polarization functions IIt and II and has been neglected in all previous calculations of the electron thermal conductivity (where one has com- monly set IIt = II = q6, and q2 - (w/c)2+IIt = q2+ 93). Naturally, this difference is expected to be small for non- relativistic electrons (e < c), where the transverse cur- rent interaction term is small in the matrix element. We will see that the difference becomes important for rela- tivistic electrons (ve c).The plasma screening was thoroughly analyzed by Heiselberg and Pethick [ 17. These authors studied quark-quark interaction through one-gluon exchange in the weak-coupling limit which is very similar to the Coulomb interaction in an ordinary plasma. The matrixdensity and the temperature. Their calculation reduces to the calculation of the function I(u,) from Eq. (11') Clearly, the function can be written asLet us recall that the functions II and It have real parts which describe plasmon refraction, and imaginary parts which describe plasmon absorption. In the ee scattering we deal with low-energy virtual plasmons, hw kpT. As seen from Eq. (9), longitudinal plas- mons undergo refraction which results in the Debye-type (Thomas-Fermi) screening of the Coulomb interaction, with the screening momentum (inverse screening length) Go. As for transverse plasmons, they mainly undergo col- lisionless absorption (that is the Landau damping) by degenerate electrons. Their effect is drastically different from the effect of longitudinal plasmons.  
> I = It + It + It : (13)where I is the contribution from the ee interaction via the exchange of longitudinal plasmons (the first term in the squared modulus); It comes from the interaction via the exchange of transverse plasmons (the second term); and It is the mixed term.The analysis reveals four regimes (I-IV) of ee collisions in a strongly degenerate electron gas. These regimes are summarized in Table I. The regimes I and II are realized for non-relativistic electrons, while in the regimes III and IV electrons are ultrarelativistic. The regimes I and III take place for sufficiently high temperatures T Tpe, at which the Pauli principle does not restrict energy trans- fers between colliding electrons (hw_< kpT; see, e.g, Lampe [131, especially his Fig. 1). The regimes II and IV refer to a colder electron gas, where energy transfers are essentially limited by the Pauli blocking (e.g., Lampe [13] and Flowers and Itoh [14]).The calculations similar to those in Ref. [17] lead to the following expressions for the ee collision frequency and thermal conductivity,

Both components of the matrix element, and the interference term is negligibly small because of the small-momentum-transfer approximation. Further- more, w = hw/kpT; $ is the angle between Pit and P2t, the components of pi and pe transverse_to q; and the integration over $ is trivial. Equations ( (0) and (d1) are natural generalizations of Eqs. (58) and (59) of Heisel- berg and Pethick [7] to the case of a degenerate gas of particles of arbitrary degree of relativity (in our case /c may be arbitrary while in Ref. [17] = c). The dif- ference of numerical factors in the expressions for in our Eq. @0) and in Eq. (58) of Ref. [j [17 (108 versus 24) stems from the difference of physical systems under con- sideration (an electron gas versus a gas of light quarks interacting through gluon exchange).The logarithmic terms in brackets represent Coulomb logarithms, while the second terms are the corrections calculated using the standard technique [13]. The lead- ing contribution comes from I. It was calculated by Lampe [3], with a slightly less accurate correction term (1.30 2/15 0.173 from his Eqs. (5.22) and (5.23), in- stead of our 0.1657).

## III. FOUR REGIMES OF ELECTRON-ELECTRON COLLISIONS
Thus the collision frequency and the thermal conduc- tivity (10) are solely determined by the electron numberUsing Eqs. @0) and @3) we can decompose the col- lision frequency -vee into the same parts as I, Vee = v( nea2(kBT)2/(hq3cr,l) T The collision frequency u4v by replacing ser,l. - Qser,t. The factor u4 takes into account the re- duction of the ee interaction via transverse plasmons inNote that for It the regime I extends to lower tempera- tures T uTpe, than for I and Iit, but this circumstance does not affect noticeably the thermal conductivity Kee because I is relatively insignificant in the given regime.

(16) CYIn the regime II, where 1 and u < 1, the exchange of longitudinal plasmons dominates, and we have I I,Again, the logarithmic terms are Coulomb logarithms and the second terms are corrections. In this case, all terms (I, It, and It) give comparable contributions into The asymptote of I in this regime was obtained 1. by Heiselberg and Pethick [17] (their Eq. (60), with slightly less accurate correction factor 0.30 instead of our 0.3884) in their studies of quark plasma. For an elec- tron plasma, the conductivity Kee in the regime III was calculated by Urpin_and Yakovlev [15]. 7 Their result is equivalent to Eq. (í6 for I but with less accurate cor- rection (ln(2)/3 0.231 instead of 0.3884) because they erroneously used the approximation of static longitudi- nal electron screening of the Coulomb interaction in all terms (with II = IIt = qδ in Eq. (6)). Employing I from Eq. (@16) in the regime III we obtain

(19)This leading_part of kee in the regime II was calculated by Lampe [131. Note that the asymptotic expression @8) for It at u < 1 is actually valid not at T Tpe, as the expressions for I and It, but at lower T uTpe. How- ever, this circumstance is relatively unimportant because it is I which dominates in the regime II.In the regime IV, where 1 and u 1, the exchange of transverse plasmons dominates, with I It, and

This regime has been discussed in detail by Heiselberg and Pethick [17] for quark plasma. For the electron plasma, it was considered by Flow- ers and Itoh [14] and also by Urpin and Yakovlev [15] but both groups erroneously used the approximation of static longitudinal screening in all channels (xi = Xt = 1) which strongly underestimates the efficiency of the plasma screening of the ee interaction in the ultrarela- tivistic electron gas., If that approximation were true, Kee is significantly lower than predicted by the previous calculations [14, 15].In the regimes II and IV (where 6 1 and u 1 is arbitrary) we have  
T5 u It = 2(3) 1/3 (18) 15u03 02 68/3 (2T)2/3 18.52, 3where (z) is the Riemann zeta function (with (3) = 1.202) and T(z) is the gamma function. The expres- sion for It_(with u = 1) was obtained by Heiselberg and Pethick [07] for an ultrarelativistic quark plasma.The_asymptotic expressions are derived from (18) Eq. @1)_with the screening functions Xi and Xt given by Eq. (9). In this approximation the screening of the ee interaction via the exchange of longitudinal plasmons (the first part of the matrix element in Eq. (5) is de- scribed by q2 + II q2 + qδ, which is equivalent to the static Debye-type screening with the screening wavenum- ber Qscr, = qo. The screening via the exchange of trans- verse plasmons (the second part of the matrix element) is more complicated. It is described by the denominator term q2 - w2/c2 + IIt q2 + iqδTwve/(4qc2) that repre- sents the dynamical screening via the Landau damping of transverse plasmons, with hw kT < uehq (i.e., with low phase velocities w/q ve). In this case the ef- fective screening wavenumber qscr,t is evidently given by q3cr,t q2wve/c2 q2kBTve/(hc2).Let us note that the temperature behavior of Kee (Ta- ble I) corresponds to an ordinary_Fermi-liquid (where 1/T; e.g., Baym and Pethick 221) only in the regime II. In the regimes I and III the plasma is too warm (al- though degenerate) to reach the Fermi-liquid limit, where energy transfers between colliding particles are strongly restricted by the Pauli principle. In the regime IV the plasma is cold but the matrix element of the ee interac- tion essentially depends on energy transfers hw owing to the Landau damping of transverse plasmons which vio- lates the Fermi-liquid behavior [ [17]To facilitate applications, we have calculated the func- tions In, It and Iut from Eq. @i') for a dense grid of u and and fitted the numerical data by analytic functions.

The shaded regions I-IV show the temperature-density domains with the different regimes of ee collisions in a degenerate electron gas (see Section (I, Table II).
## IV. ] DISCUSSION
Let us discuss the efficiency of ee collisions for thermal conduction in a degenerate electron gas. Figure 'l shows the temperature-density diagram for a dense matter. For certainty, we have adopted the model of cold-catalyzed (ground-state) matter. It is composed of electrons and ions (atomic nuclei) at densities smaller than the neutron drip density Pnd 4 1011 g cm-3 (the right vertical dot- ted line), with an addition of free neutrons at higher den- sities p. The composition of the cold-catalyzed matter is taken from Haensel and Pichon 23] at <Pnd and from Negele and Vautherin [24] at higher . Weak first-oder phase transitions which accompany changes of ground- state nuclides with the growth of are smoothed out as described by Kaminker et al. [25]. . At p < 108 g cm-3 the ground-state matter is composed of iron (56Fe). The densities 109 g cm-3 are appropriate for degenerate stellar cores of white dwarfs and evolved stars; the den- sities 1014 are appropriate for envelopes (crusts) of neutron stars.In order to explore the importance of the ee collisions for thermal conduction let us compare Kee with the ther- mal conductivity Kei owing to ei collisions (Section I). The conductivity Kei is calculated using the formalism of Potekhin et al. [12 and Gnedin et al. [6].In Figure 2 we plot the temperature dependence of the electron thermal conductivity of helium (4He) or carbon (12C) plasmas at = 105 g cm-3 (left) or 106 g cm-3 (right). At p = 105 g cm-3 the electrons are nonrelativis- tic while at p = 10ö g cm-3 they are mildly relativistic. According to Eq. (2), the total electron thermal conduc- tivity Ke is determined by the partial contributions Kee

Dot-and-dashed lines (ei) show the conductivity Kei owing to ei collisions at T = i07, 108, and 109 K in a crystal of atomic nuclei for pure ground-state matter. In addition, the lower dot-and-dashed line at T = 107 K shows Kei which includes the contribution of electron scattering by impurity nuclei at T = 107 K (for nimp/n; = 0.05 andZimp - Zi= 2). The dashed line is Kee; it is almost independent of T. The dotted line is the partial conductivity ? mediated by longitudinal plasmons alone at T = 108 K; it scales as T-1. The solid lines show the total electron conductivity Ke. at T = 107 K for the matter without and with impurities. If T 108 K the effect of impurities is weak and ke Kei.and Kei, a minimum partial contribution being most im- portant. The total conductivities are shown by the solid lines; Kei by the dot-and-dashed lines; Kee is plotted by the dashed lines (the same for the helium and carbon plasmas); the dotted lines give Kee neglecting the contri- bution of transverse plasmons (i.e., by setting I = Ii).For the densities and temperatures displayed in Figure 2, the ei collisions are mainly more efficient than the ee ones, although the contribution of the ee collisions into the total thermal conductivity is noticeable. One can see that the ei collisions are more important for heavier elements (because the Coulomb ei scattering cross sec- tion is much higher than the ee scattering cross section for high-Z elements; see Lampe [ [31). The ee collisions would be negligible for the iron plasma if the data for this plasma were displayed in Figure The ee collisions are more efficient in the helium plasma than in the carbon plasma because the helium ions have lower charges. For a given chemical composition, Kee gives highest contri- bution into Ke at temperatures T a few times lower than Tpe (we have log1o Tpe[K] 7.86 and 8.32 at p = 105 and 106 g cm-3, respectively). These temperatures separate the high-temperature and low-temperature ee collision regimes (e.g., the regimes I and II in the non-relativistic electron gas, see Table ). For p = 105 g cm-3, the elec- tron gas is only slightly relativistic. Accordingly, the con- tribution of the Landau damping (transverse plasmons) into Kee is relatively small, and the results of Lampe [13] the contribution of the Landau damping becomes more important which invalidates the previous results of Refs. 4 15]. In this case the Landau damping strongly re- duces Kee which makes the ee collisions much more im- portant for thermal conduction than it was thought be- fore. For still higher p the contribution of Kee into Ke in a plasma of light elements at T Tpe would be even more significant. However, the temperature Tpe wouldbecome so high that light elements would start burning in thermonuclear reactions. Therefore, ee collisions can noticeably decrease the electron thermal conductivity at densities and temperatures important for nuclear burn- ing of light elements (for instance, in the vicinity of the carbon ignition curve). This should be taken into ac- count in simulations of nuclear evolution of stars (e.g, carbon ignition in white dwarfs [).Figure shows the density dependence of the elec- tron thermal conductivity, in the density range from 2.5 x 109 g cm-3 to 1014 g cm-3 for the three val- ues of the temperature T = 107, 108, and 109 K. We employ the same model of ground-state matter as in Fig- ure i. The displayed density range is appropriate to a crust of a neutron star. The vertical dotted line is the neutron drip point which separates the crust into the outer and inner parts. 7 The adopted values of T and refer to the regime IV of the ee collisions, where the elec- tron gas is ultrarelativistic, T < Tpe, and the Landau damping dominates. The conductivity Kee (the dashed line) is well approximated by the temperature indepen-dent conductivity @) governed y the Landau damping: Kee slightly deviatesfrom Eq. (@0) only at lowest for T = 109 in Figure 2 where T is still insufficiently lower than Tpe (see Figure(l). Retaining the longitudinal con- tribution into Kee (I= Ii) and setting T = 108 K, we would get the dotted curve in Fig. 3 It goes much higher than the dashed curve indicating that this longitudinal contribution is really insignificant.are weakly coupled and constitute a Boltzmann gas. The calculation of the ion polarization functions at lower T (in the regime of strong ion coupling, in an ion liquid or solid) is a complicated problem whose detailed solu- tion is still absent. We have also neglected the effects of strong magnetic fields which can greatly modify electron heat transport in strongly magnetized neutron star en- velopes. These effects are numerous (e.g., Yakovlev and Kaminker [26]) and are subdivided into classical (owing to rapid electron Larmor rotation) and quantum ones (owing to the Landau quantization of electron motion in a magnetic field). In principle, a proper treatment of ee collisions in a strong magnetic field can be performed in the same framework of the dynamical plasma screening as used above. However, the problem becomes much more complicated because the electron polarization tensor in a magnetic field is anisotropic (depends on the relative ori- entations of the wavevector q and the magnetic field) and cannot be generally decomposed into purely longitudinal and transverse parts [ @i. The effects of ion polarization and strong magnetic fields are outside the scope of the present paper.For comparison, the dot-and-dashed lines in Figure give the thermal conductivity Kei (mostly from Figure 4 of Ref. [6l) for the same values of T, and the solid lines give the total conductivity Ke: For T = 108 and 109, the effects of possible impurities in dense matter (atomic nuclei with charge numbers Zimp different from charge numbers Z; of ground-state nuclei) are expected to be small (e.g., Gnedin et al. [). At T_= 107 K, the effects of impurities can be substantial. For this T in Figure 3 we present Kei and Ke for pure ground-state matter and also for the matter which contains impurities with Zimp - Zil = 2 and with the fractional number of im- purity nuclei of nimp/n = 0.05. The impurities increase the ei collision rate and decrease the conductivities Kei and Ke.As seen from Figure 3, Kei is more important than Kee at all displayed densities for T = 108 and 109 K. In these cases Ke Kei and we do not show Ke to simplify the figure. However, Kee dominates in the pure ground-state matter for T = 107 K at p 1012 g cm-3 (in the inner crust of a neutron star). This dominance is fully pro- duced by the Landau damping of transverse plasmons in the ee-collisions. For p 1013 g cm-3 in this case we have Ke Kee. For an impure cold-catalyzed matter Kei remains important for all densities at T = 107 K, but Kee is comparable to Kei in the inner neutron star crust. Note that the values of <ei in Figure take into account, in an approximate manner, the freezing of Umklapp pro- cesses in electron-phonon scattering at low temperatures (see, e.g., Ref. [0). For T 108 K the freezing is unim- portant, but at T 107 K it enhances Kei. A more rig- orous treatment of this freezing can partly remove this enhancement (A. I. Chugunov, private communication), which can somewhat decrease Kei and reduce the impor- tance of Kee.
## V. CONCLUSIONS
We have reconsidered the electron thermal conductiv- ity Kee of degenerate electrons produced owing to the ee collisions taking into account the Landau damping due to the exchange of transverse plasmons (following the calculations of kinetic properties of quark plasma by Heiselberg and Pethick [17]). The Landau damping has been neglected in all previous calculations of Kee: We have analyzed the four regimes of the ee collisions in the degenerate electron gas (Section i, Table ) and ob- tained analytic expressions for Kee which accurately ap- proximate the results of numerical calculations of cee in wide ranges of the temperature and density of the matter. These results can be applied to study thermal conduction of degenerate electrons in metals, semiconductors, in de- generate cores of evolved stars and white dwarfs, and in envelopes of neutron stars.
* Our main conclusions are the following.
Therefore, a correct treatment of ee collisions can con- siderably reduce the electron thermal conductivity in a cold neutron star crust, with T 107 K. This can in- crease the time of heat diffusion from the inner crust to the surface [9. In particular, the effect can be impor- tant for the propagation of thermal waves produced by pulsar glitches and for the emergence of these waves on the pulsar surface. The emergence can be, in principle, observed and give valuable information on the nature of pulsar glitches .
* (1) The Landau damping strongly modifies Kee in a relativistic degenerate electron gas, at densities 106 g cm-3, but it is also quite noticeable at lower (for instance, at p = 105 g cm-3, see Figure2). The Lan- dau damping increases the ce collision rate and decreases Kee, increasing the contribution of the ee collisions into the total electron thermal conductivity Ke:
* (2) The most dramatic effect of the Landau damping on Kee takes place at p > 106 g cm-3 for temperatures T much below the electron plasma temperature Tpe (the regime IV, Table I). In this case Kee shows a non-Fermi- liquid behavior; it becomes temperature independent and is described by the asymptotic expression (@2d).
While calculating Kee we have taken into account only the electron contribution into the polarization functions I and II in Eq. (6) and neglected the ion contribution. As shown by Lampe [3] this is a good approximation at high temperatures T Z2e2/(akB) at which the ions
* (3) The conductivity Kee becomes comparable to the electron thermal conductivity Kei provided by the
electron-ion collisions (and gives thus a noticeable contri- bution into the total conductivity ke) in a warm plasma of light (low-Z) ions at temperatures T a few times lower than Tpe (Figure 2). These conditions are typical for degenerate cores of white dwarfs and giant stars where thermonuclear burning of light elements can occur (par- ticularly, in the vicinity of the carbon ignition curve).ity should also be reconsidered taking into account the Landau damping. Our present results cannot be directly applied to this case because in the cores the electrons col- lide efficiently at least with degenerate electrons, muons, and protons, and these collisions deserve a special study We intend to analyze them in a subsequent publication.
* (4) The conductivity Kee dominates over Kei and de- termines the total electron thermal conductivity Ke of the dense pure cold-catalyzed matter at T 107 K and 1012 g cm-3 (in the inner crust of a cold neutron star, Figure 3. At these T and the conductivity Kee is important even for impure cold-catalyzed matter. It can affect the propagation of thermal waves, excited in the inner neutron star crust during pulsar glitches, to the pulsar surface.
