 The  table  or  text  chunk  discuss es  a  scientific  study  on  the  impact  of  the  electron - elect ron  c us p  on  the  convergence  of  configuration  interaction  ( CI )  wave  functions .  The  study  exam ines  the  effect  by  replacing  the  true  C oul omb  electron - elect ron  interaction  with  a  smooth  and  finite  effective  interaction  that  closely  reprodu ces  the  scattering  of  the  C oul omb  interaction  but  is  smooth  at  zero  electron - elect ron  separation .  The  authors  perform  C I  and  quantum  Monte  Carlo  calculations  for  He  and  Be  atoms  with  both  the  C oul omb  and  the  effective  interaction .  They  find  that  the  convergence  of  the  C I  expansion  for  the  smooth  effective  interaction  is  not  significantly  improved  compared  to  the  C oul omb  interaction ,  indicating  that  the  description  of  the  electron - elect ron  c us p  is  not  a  limiting  factor  for  C I  calculations  within  chemical  accuracy .  The  study  concl udes  that  the  slow  convergence  of  C I  expans ions  should  be  attributed  to  difficulties  in  describing  intermediate - range  electronic  correlation  rather  than  the  inter elect ron  c us p .
